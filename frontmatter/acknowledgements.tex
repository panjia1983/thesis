There are many people who through support, kindness, and constructive conflict have contributed a great deal to my research in graduate school and eventually this thesis.  First and foremost, I want to thank my advisor Dinesh Manocha who has both been a constant source of guidance throughout my entire five years here.  Dinesh has at every point pushed me to accomplish as much as possible during my time at the department. I have also benefited greatly from my committee members.


I would additional like to thank Liangjun Zhang, both for his cheerful mentorship and for introducing me to robotics -- which would forever change my research career.  I've also been blessed with a large supply of collaborators in Gamma research group.

I would also like to thank my parents who have always done anything possible to support my education and nurture my development.
